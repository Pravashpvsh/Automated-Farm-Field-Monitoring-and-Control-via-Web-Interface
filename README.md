# Automated Farm Field Monitoring and Control via Web Interface

## Overview
The "Automated Farm Field Monitoring and Control" system is designed to automate the monitoring and management of farm fields. It uses sensors to track soil moisture, humidity, temperature, water levels, and storage conditions, and adjusts irrigation based on real-time data. The system also includes a movable camera for visual monitoring of the field. Powered by Arduino and ESP32, with a web interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this system enables farmers to remotely manage and monitor their farms.

## Problem Statement
Manual monitoring of environmental variables such as soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and water levels is time-consuming and prone to human error. This system automates data collection and irrigation control, improving resource efficiency and helping farmers make informed decisions to optimize crop growth and reduce water wastage.

## Features
- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Continuously tracks soil moisture levels to prevent over- or under-watering.
- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Monitors ambient temperature and humidity to maintain optimal conditions for plant growth.
- **Irrigation Control**: Automatically activates irrigation systems based on real-time soil moisture data.
- **Water Level Monitoring**: Keeps track of water levels in storage tanks to ensure a continuous water supply.
- **Movable Camera**: Allows real-time visual monitoring of the field, enabling farmers to check crop health and environmental conditions from any angle.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly dashboard to monitor conditions and control irrigation remotely.
- **Data Logging and Alerts**: Stores sensor data and sends alerts when conditions exceed defined thresholds.

## Architecture
- **Sensors**: Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and water level sensors collect real-time environmental data.
- **Microcontroller (Arduino & ESP32)**: These microcontrollers interface with sensors and manage the communication between the field devices and the web interface.
- **Movable Camera**: The camera provides real-time video feed, which can be controlled through the web interface for field inspection.
- **Web Interface**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display real-time data and allow user interaction.
- **Database**: Stores sensor data for historical analysis and decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Arduino, ESP32, soil moisture sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, water level sensor, movable camera, various other environmental sensors.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js (if applicable), ESP32 for communication
- **Database**: MySQL or Firebase (if applicable)
- **Communication Protocol**: HTTP or MQTT for data transmission between sensors and the web interface

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pravashpvsh/Automated-Farm-Field-Monitoring-and-Control-via-Web-Interface.git
   ```

2. **Set up the hardware**:
   - Connect the soil moisture sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, water level sensor, and the movable camera to the Arduino or ESP32.
   - Upload the appropriate firmware to the Arduino/ESP32 using the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

3. **Install software dependencies**:
   - For the web interface, navigate to the project directory and install any required dependencies for the backend (if any):
     - For Node.js:
       ```bash
       npm install
       ```
     - If using ESP32, ensure you have the required libraries installed for communicating with sensors (e.g., `DHT` for temperature and humidity, `LiquidCrystal` for LCD, `SoilMoistureSensor` for soil moisture, etc.).

4. **Upload the code**:
   - Upload the Arduino/ESP32 code that reads data from the sensors and controls the movable camera.
   - The code should handle sensor readings, triggering irrigation, moving the camera, and sending data to the backend or directly to the web interface using HTTP requests.

5. **Run the backend server** (if applicable):
   - For Node.js:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```
 

6. **Access the web interface**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the dashboard and interact with the system.

## How It Works
- **Sensor Data Collection**: The Arduino or ESP32 collects data from the connected sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and water levels).
- **Data Transmission**: The sensor data is sent to the backend or directly to the web interface using HTTP or MQTT protocols.
- **Movable Camera Control**: The camera can be controlled remotely through the web interface to view different areas of the field.
- **Data Processing**: The system processes the data and triggers actions like activating irrigation, moving the camera, or alerting the user when thresholds are crossed.
- **User Interaction**: The web interface allows users to monitor field conditions, control irrigation, and move the camera remotely.

## Future Improvements
- **Machine Learning**: Integrating AI for predictive irrigation, crop health analysis, and growth pattern predictions.
- **Mobile App**: Create a mobile app to allow farmers to monitor and control the system on the go.
- **Weather API Integration**: Use weather data to adjust irrigation schedules more accurately.
- **Automatic Camera Movement**: Implement automated camera control based on the area of interest, such as focusing on areas with low moisture or high temperatures.
- **Drone Integration**: Consider integrating drones for aerial monitoring of large fields.
